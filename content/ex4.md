# E4: 3D Visualization and 3D Animation
## Warm Up
### Common Types of 3D Data
3D data can appear in many formats and domains:  
- **Point clouds** üü¢ (from LiDAR, photogrammetry, laser scanning)  
- **Meshes** üï∏Ô∏è (triangular or polygonal surfaces from 3D modeling)  
- **Voxel data** üßä (3D pixels, often used in medical imaging or volumetric models)  
- **3D building models** üè¢ (e.g., CityGML, BIM data, CAD models)  
- **DEM/DSM** (Digital Elevation/Surface Models, raster grids with height values)

### 2.5D(Pseudo 3D) vs. 3D Data

| Aspect               | 2.5D (Pseudo-3D)                        | True 3D                                  |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `Geometry`            | One z-value per (x, y)                   | Multiple z-values per (x, y) possible    |
| `Representation`       | Raster grid (DEM/DSM), extruded polygons | Point clouds, meshes, voxels, solids     |
| `Complexity`           | Relatively simple                       | More complex data structures             |
| `Storage & Processing` | Lightweight, fast                        | Heavy, requires advanced computation     |
| `Can model overlaps?`  | ‚ùå No                                    | ‚úÖ Yes (bridges, tunnels, multi-floors)  |
| `Main Use Cases`       | Terrain, surface analysis, quick 3D view | Urban modeling, subsurface, indoor 3D    |

- **2.5D is enough** when you only care about terrain or building heights.  
- **True 3D is necessary** when you need full volumetric analysis or overlapping structures.  
- In geodesy, we often start with 2.5D (e.g., DEMs) but increasingly move to **full 3D** for city models, infrastructure, and digital twins.
- 2.5D is also common in video games and VR.

### How Do We Get 3D Data?

This is a huge topic that connects to many industries: *Robotics, Autonomous Driving (AD), Gaming, Digital Design, Architecture, Geodesy*, and more.  
Broadly speaking, there are two ways: **direct measurement** (sensors record 3D geometry in real-world coordinates) and **indirect reconstruction** (3D is inferred from 2D observations or designed manually).
#### LiDAR Scanning (Airborne, Terrestrial, Mobile)
- Captures dense **point clouds** with XYZ coordinates and intensity values.  
- Can be mounted on drones, aircraft, cars, or tripods.

#### Geodetic Surveying
- GNSS / GPS surveying: directly measures 3D positions in global coordinates (WGS84, UTM, etc.).  
- Total station or laser theodolite: high-precision ground-based measurement for engineering, construction, and geodesy.

#### Photogrammetry (Multi-View Geometry)
- Derives 3D geometry from overlapping images(aerial, drone, or satellite).
- Large-scale projects: [SRTM](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271602001247) generated near-global elevation models.  

#### 3D Computer Vision
 - Structure from Motion (SfM): reconstructs camera positions + sparse point clouds from unordered photos, ([COLMAP](https://github.com/colmap/colmap)).  
- Multi-View Stereo(MVS):  refines dense surface geometry given camera parameters, e.g. [MVSNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02505)
- Deep learning approaches:  
  - [VGGT (Vision Geometry Grounded Transformers)](https://vgg-t.github.io/): learns 3D scene geometry from multi-views.  
  - Neural rendering methods:  
    - [NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields)](https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf) ‚Äì photorealistic novel views.  
    - [3D Gaussian Splatting](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/) ‚Äì real-time 3D rendering.
 
#### Artificial Creation
- Models created by artists or engineers in CAD, BIM, or 3D modeling tools (SketchUp, Blender, 3ds Max).  
- Common in *gaming, movies, architectural visualization, digital twins*.  

```{admonition} With or Without World Coordinates?
- **Direct methods (LiDAR, GNSS, total station)** ‚Üí usually already georeferenced, so they can be integrated into GIS immediately.  
- **Indirect methods (SfM, photogrammetry without GCPs, manual design)** ‚Üí typically start in **relative coordinates** only.  
- If no information about **scale** or **world coordinates** is available, the dataset cannot be directly placed in a real-world CRS. This is why we require **Ground Control Points (GCPs)** or another external reference source (e.g., GNSS measurements) to restore accurate georeferencing.  
```

## Task
### Descriptions
In this exercise, you‚Äôll move from **2D mapping** to **3D visualization** in ArcGIS Pro. You will set up and display spatial information in three dimensions, create realistic **3D symbols** for buildings, street furniture, and monuments, capture GNSS points, and finish by producing a **3D animation** and exporting it as a video.

### Advance Task
- Automate the workflow
  Try scripting repetitive steps such as updating attributes, extruding buildings, or converting data.
```{code} python
# Update Building Heights from CSV
import arcpy
building_fc = "path/to/Buildings"
csv_table = "path/to/building_heights.csv"
arcpy.management.AddJoin(building_fc, "building_id", csv_table, "building_id")
expression = "!building_heights.levels! * 4"
arcpy.management.CalculateField(building_fc, "extrude_height", expression, "PYTHON3")

# Convert GPX to Shapefile (Python + Geopandas)
import geopandas as gpd
gpx_file = "monuments.gpx"
points = gpd.read_file(gpx_file, layer='waypoints')
points.to_file("monuments.shp", driver="ESRI Shapefile")
```
- **Exploring Heights Across Coordinate Systems**
**Elevation (Z-values)** is not as straightforward as it seems. The meaning and interpretation of ‚Äúheight‚Äù depends heavily on the **coordinate system** in use. You can investigate how **height values** described on the different spatial reference system.

- **Visualize Real Flight Trajectories in 3D**
  - Explore **real-world aviation data**, download a flight track, visualize it as a **3D path** in **Google Earth** or **ArcGIS Pro**, and see how these data is organized.
  - Download and process Real Flight Data from flight websites like:
    - [FlightRadar24](https://www.flightradar24.com/)  
    - [OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org/)  
    - [ADS-B Exchange](https://globe.adsbexchange.com/)
    - [GPSVisualizer](https://www.gpsvisualizer.com/map_input?form=googleearth)
  - Visualize in [Google Earth](https://earth.google.com/web/)
    - Google Earth can directly open **KML** or **GPX** files with 3D elevation data.
