# Portfolio: Map Design

## Warm Up

### History of Maps

Maps are **as old as civilization itself** — they helped early humans navigate the land, organize society, and make sense of the unknown.

- The **[oldest known world map](https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/oldest-maps-world)** (Babylonian, ~6th century BCE) was etched on clay, showing a stylized world with Babylon at its center.
- Ancient Greek scholars like **Ptolemy** introduced concepts such as latitude, longitude, and map projections.
- In medieval Europe, **T and O maps** placed Jerusalem at the center, blending geography with theology.


### How Were Ancient Maps Made?

Before satellites and GPS, mapmakers relied on:

- **Direct observation**: using landmarks, sun position, and time to estimate distances.
- **Compass & pacing**: early land surveyors walked and recorded angles using simple tools.
- **Dead reckoning** on ships: estimating position from speed and direction.
- **Triangulation**: from the 17th century onward, measuring distances via angles from known points.

Many early maps were **symbolic**, not literal — prioritizing cultural or religious meaning over geometric precision.

### Interesting Facts about Subway Maps

Have you ever noticed that subway or metro maps often use **only horizontal, vertical, or 45° diagonal lines**?

This is no accident. The trend was popularized by **Harry Beck’s 1933 London Underground map**, which:
- Abandoned geographical accuracy
- Focused on **clarity and simplicity**
- Aligned all lines to a **grid of 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°** for visual ease
- Used **equal station spacing** to reduce clutter

This style became so successful that it’s now the **universal design language** for transit maps worldwide.

### Overview
```{note}
:class: dropdown
- [ ] **Edit Public Transport Points**  
  - Add missing tram stops and correct bus stop symbols.  
- [ ] **Labelling**  
  - Add and style labels for bus stops, museums, streets using halo, font style, and size.  
- [ ] **Adjust Label Priorities**  
  - Avoid overlaps by setting feature/label weights and rules.  
- [ ] **Map Layout (A3 size)**  
  - Insert guides, main map frame, inset map, and define extent.

  - Title, legend, north arrow, scale bar, and grid.  
- [ ] **Design & Symbology**  
  - Refine appearance, hierarchy, and layout logic.  
- [ ] **Export**  
  - Save and export your final layout as PDF (A3, 240 dpi).  
```
- Edit data layers (e.g., correcting names, symbols, labels)
- Apply visual hierarchy and symbology
- Build a map layout in A3 format (portrait or landscape)
- Add map elements (title, legend, inset, scale bar, north arrow)
