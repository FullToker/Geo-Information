# E6: Vertical and Hydrological Analysis

## Warm Up

### Why Do We Care About Slope?

> Is every 500-meter path equally difficult? Or does slope change everything?

As the following chart illustrates, many domains‚Äîfrom urban planning to emergency access‚Äîtake **slope** and other **vertical factors** into account when designing spaces and systems. 
This applies not only to outdoor environments like roads and trails, but also to vertical spatial planning within buildings, where elevation impacts accessibility, function, and design logic. For a deeper dive into how slope and vertical costs influence movement and analysis in GIS, you can explore this article:  
[How the horizontal and vertical factors affect path distance](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/spatial-analyst/how-the-horizonal-and-vertical-factors-affect-path-distance.htm)

| Context             | Why Slope Matters                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| üö≤ Urban Planning    | Bike lanes avoid slopes >8% to stay rideable     |
| üöí Emergency Access | Fire trucks and ambulances struggle on steep roads |
| ‚õ∑Ô∏è Ski Resorts       | Slope determines difficulty level (green/blue/black) |
| üß± Vertical Planning | Vertical spatial design affects building function layering and elevation access |
| üèóÔ∏è Construction      | Affects drainage, foundation design, and costs    |
| üö∂ Accessibility     | Wheelchair paths require very gentle slopes       |

### Finding the ‚ÄúBest‚Äù Path ‚Äî Is Shortest Always Best?

> ‚ÄúWhy doesn‚Äôt Google Maps take me in a straight line?‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt we just draw a line from A to B and walk it?‚Äù

| Route Type          | What Happens             | Why                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| ü•æ Mountain Trails   | Zigzags instead of straight lines | To avoid steep climbs |
| üöó City Driving      | Detours are often faster | Due to traffic, turns, signals |
| ü¶å Animal Migration  | Never straight lines     | Optimized for safety, energy, terrain |

> Key Concept: **Shortest ‚â† Optimal**.  

The ‚Äúbest‚Äù route often minimizes **cost**, not distance.
Cost can mean:
- Time
- Energy (e.g. uphill walking)
- Safety (avoiding cliffs or danger zones)
- Environmental impact (avoiding protected areas)

**Least Cost Path Analysis** in GIS finds the route from start to end that has the lowest total cost ‚Äî not just in meters, but factoring in terrain and other variables.

## Task
### Descriptions
In this exercise, you will explore **vertical, hydrological, and cost surface analysis** using raster data in ArcGIS Pro.  
The goal is to understand how elevation and terrain influence visibility, water flow, and optimal routing decisions in mountainous regions. Detailed instructions in {download}`Lesson 6 <../doc/[Outdated] Lesson 6.docx>`

#### Data
- `DEM_50m_Zugsp.tif`  
- `LandCover.tif`  

### Overview
```{note}
:class: dropdown
- [ ] **Vertical Analysis**  
  - visualize elevation, slope, aspect, and hypsometric tints in 3D scenes.  
- [ ] **Line-of-Sight (Viewshed)**  
  - calculate visible areas from selected viewpoints using DEM.  
- [ ] **Hydrological Analysis**  
  - compute flow direction, flow accumulation, and identify drainage basins.  
- [ ] **Cost Surface Analysis**  
  - create a cost surface using slope and land cover data.  
- [ ] **Least Cost Path**  
  - determine the optimal route between two points minimizing environmental and slope cost.  
---
```

#### 1. Vertical Analysis
- Start a *Local Scene* in ArcGIS Pro.  
- Replace Esri‚Äôs default elevation with `DEM_50m_Zugsp.tif` as the custom *elevation source*.  
- Run the **Slope** and **Aspect** tools from the Spatial Analyst toolbox.  
- Generate a histogram of slope values.  
- Apply *hypsometric tints* using symbology with equal interval classification.

#### 2. Line-of-Sight (Viewshed)
- Use the *Viewshed* tool to simulate line-of-sight from observer points.  
- Create points directly on the DEM within the local scene.  
- Analyze which areas are visible based on terrain.

#### 3. Hydrological Analysis
- Run the following tools on the DEM:  
  - *Flow Direction* (D8 method, force edges to flow outward)  
  - *Flow Accumulation*  
  - *Basin* tool to delineate drainage areas  
- Visualize drainage basins with unique colors and adjust transparency to overlay with flow accumulation.

#### 4. Cost Surface Analysis
- Add `LandCover.tif` and Reclassify land use values based on environmental impact.  
- Optionally Reclassify slope values to match scale.  
- Combine reclassified rasters using the *Plus* tool to generate the *cost surface*.

#### 5. Least Cost Path
- Change scene coordinate system to `WGS 1984 UTM Zone 32N`.  
- Use the *Least Cost Path* tool:  
  - Input your combined cost surface  
  - Create start and end points interactively  
  - Generate the optimal hiking trail based on your criteria
