# E10: Open geospatial Data

## Warm Up
### Open Source vs Closed Source
Before diving into **open geospatial data**, let’s pause and think about a bigger question:
> What does it mean for software or data to be *open*?  

Here’s a basic comparison between **open-source** and **closed-source (proprietary)** software:
| Feature                  | Open Source                           | Closed Source                            |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Access to Code**       | Fully visible and editable             | Hidden from the public                    |
| **Usage Rights**         | Usually free to use and modify         | Requires license or payment               |
| **Community Contribution**| Anyone can contribute or fork         | Only internal developers can edit         |
| **Security**             | Transparent (bugs visible & fixable)   | Obscured (depends on vendor response)     |
| **Examples**             | QGIS, Linux, Python, PostgreSQL        | ArcGIS, Windows, Google Earth Pro         |

- **Operating Systems**:  
  In the 90s and 2000s, Linux rose as a symbol of open-source power — challenging Microsoft Windows in server and academic environments. The **GNU/Linux** movement showed that free and open software could be reliable and secure.

- **Modern AI and LLMs**:  
  Today, the open vs closed debate reappears in AI.  
  - Closed: ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude  
  - Open: [Meta’s LLaMA](https://ai.meta.com/llama/), [DeepSeek](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai), Mistral  
  Open models allow researchers and developers to experiment freely and drive innovation.  

> Open-source LLMs are especially valuable because training foundational models is largely limited to a few big tech companies. For other companies and universities, it’s just impossible to train such models from scratch. Open-source releases make it possible for researchers and startups to study, fine-tune, and deploy models locally. This openness has enabled a wave of innovation in AI applications, allowing broader participation rather than leaving the field entirely dominated by tech giants.

### Open Source Licenses: What’s Allowed?

Just because something is open-source doesn’t mean you can do anything with it.

Different licenses come with different freedoms and responsibilities. Here are a few major ones:

| License       | Key Characteristics                                                                 | Example Projects        |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **GNU GPL**   | Copyleft license: requires derived works to also be open under GPL                   | [Linux](https://www.linux.org/), [QGIS](https://qgis.org/)             |
| **MIT**       | Very permissive: allows reuse in open or closed projects with minimal conditions     | [React](https://react.dev/), [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/)       |
| **Apache 2.0**| Similar to MIT but with explicit patent protection                                   | [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)     |
| **Creative Commons (CC)** | Often used for open data or content, e.g., maps or images                | [OpenStreetMap (CC BY-SA)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=6/51.33/10.45)|

> The **GNU GPL (General Public License)** ensures that *if you share a modified version*, it must stay open and free for others.

Even in commercial contexts, **open and closed often co-exist**:

- Microsoft now supports Linux and open-source tools (like GitHub).
- ESRI’s ArcGIS is closed-source, but supports open formats (GeoJSON, Shapefile) and integrates with open Python libraries.
- Facebook uses PyTorch (open-source), but builds closed AI products.
#### Why People(Include me) Still Believe in Open Source

Despite business pressures, many developers (myself included!) continue to believe:

> "Open-source helps humanity. It enables learning, collaboration, and shared progress."

- You can learn from the best by reading real code.
- You can adapt tools to your needs — especially important in underfunded communities or research.
- You can **build upon others’ work instead of starting from scratch**.

### OpenGIS
The concept of OpenGIS encompasses two core pillars that establish a comprehensive framework of *Standards, Tools, and Data*:
- Open Standards: Defined primarily by the OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium), these standards ensure interoperability, allowing different systems to communicate seamlessly without vendor lock-in.
- Open Source: This refers to the [FOSS4G (Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial)](https://www.osgeo.org/initiatives/foss4g/) ecosystem, which provides accessible software tools such as QGIS, PostGIS, and GeoServer.

#### The Philosophy
Interoperability: This is the soul of OpenGIS. It ensures that different software systems communicate effectively. Through these standards, web browsers display satellite maps seamlessly, and proprietary software reads open-source data without compatibility issues.

#### The Standards
The [OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium)](https://www.ogc.org/) standards serve as the "universal language" for the industry.
- **Data Service Standards**:
    1. WMS (Web Map Service): Transmits rendered map images (map tiles) for display.
    2. WFS (Web Feature Service): Transmits actual vector data objects (points, lines, polygons) for analysis.
    3. WCS (Web Coverage Service): Transmits coverage data containing raw pixel values, such as elevation or temperature models.
- **Data Format Standards**: Includes GeoPackage (a modern, efficient alternative to Shapefiles), GeoJSON (for web use), and KML.

#### The Stack
The FOSS4G (Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial) ecosystem offers robust tools for every layer of the application.
- Database Layer (Storage): PostgreSQL + PostGIS. This combination acts as the industry de facto standard for spatial data storage.
- Server Layer (Publishing): GeoServer or MapServer. These tools publish stored data to the web using OGC standards.
- Desktop Layer (Analysis): QGIS. This is the primary interface for professionals to analyze data and design maps.
- Client Layer (Visualization): Leaflet, OpenLayers, or MapLibre GL. These libraries enable the rendering of interactive maps in web browsers.
- Processing Layer (Library): GDAL/OGR. This library functions as the cornerstone of almost all GIS software, handling data translation and processing.

#### Open Data
- **OpenStreetMap (OSM)**: Functioning as the "Wikipedia" of the mapping world, this project relies on VGI (Volunteered Geographic Information) to build a global, community-maintained dataset.
- **Government Open Data**: Agencies such as NASA and ESA (Sentinel Hub) provide open access to vast amounts of remote sensing and satellite imagery.


## Task
### Data

- {download}`Beijing_roads_OSM <../data/E9/beijing_osm_roads.geojson>`
- {download}`Beijing_roads_official <../data/E9/beijing_official_roads.shp>`
- {download}`Districts_shapefile <../data/E9/beijing_districts.geojson>`
- {download}`School_POI_OSM <../data/E9/schools_osm.geojson>`


### Task 1: Download OSM Data using QuickOSM in QGIS
Use the QuickOSM plugin to directly query OSM features.

**Steps:**
- Install QuickOSM plugin in QGIS.
- Query for features like:
  - `highway = primary`
  - `amenity = school`
  - `building = hospital`
- Explore the structure of downloaded data and visualize by category.
- Save layers locally as GeoJSON or Shapefile.

---

### Task 2: Analyze and Compare Road Networks

Use two sources of road data: official shapefile vs. OSM data.

**Steps:**
- Load both layers into QGIS.
- Use topology tools to check connectivity.
- Compare coverage using `Difference` or `Intersection`.
- Count and visualize roads missing from one dataset.
- Optional: Buffer main roads and analyze coverage of public amenities.

---

### Task 3: Spatial Analysis with OSM Features

**Example use case:** Are schools evenly distributed across districts?

**Steps:**
- Use OSM school POIs.
- Use `Count points in polygon` to aggregate by district.
- Normalize by area or population (if available).
- Visualize as a choropleth map.

---

### Advanced Task

- Write your own Overpass API query using [Overpass Turbo](https://overpass-turbo.eu/)
- Export the result as GeoJSON and import into QGIS.
- Try querying different `amenity`, `landuse`, or `public_transport` tags.
