# E7: Network Analysis

## Warm Up
### Graph Theory & Graph Neural Networks

Closely related to **network analysis** are the fields of **graph theory** and **graph neural networks (GNNs)**.  

Graph theory originates from the famous **K√∂nigsberg Seven Bridges Problem** proposed by Euler in the 18th century. He asked whether it was possible to walk through the city of K√∂nigsberg and cross each of its seven bridges exactly once. 
Although the answer was ‚Äúno,‚Äù this puzzle laid the foundation for graph theory ‚Äî the mathematical study of **nodes (vertices)** and **edges (links)**.  
![Seven Bridges Problem](../images/ex7/Konigsberg_bridges.png "The illustration of K√∂nigsberg Bridge problem")

> In graph theory, a tree is essentially a special kind of graph ‚Äî one that is connected and contains no cycles.

Building upon graph theory, **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** extend deep learning to irregular data structured as graphs. 
Instead of images or sequences, GNNs learn from graph-structured inputs where relationships matter as much as individual features. 
Applications include:  
- *Traffic prediction* (modeling flow and congestion on road networks).  
- *Social and spatial interaction modeling* (spread of diseases, information, or urban activity).  

Thus, from Euler‚Äôs simple bridge puzzle to today‚Äôs deep learning methods, graph-based thinking continues to provide powerful tools for analyzing, predicting, and optimizing complex spatial networks.  

### Shortest Path in a Network
One scientist once described this iconic problem by saying: ‚ÄúThe shortest path is a beautiful problem that anyone in the world can understand.‚Äù 

You have learned **Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm** in the lecture ‚Äî the most famous and classical shortest-path algorithm that is widely used in daily applications. 
In 2024, it was even proved to have **Universal Optimality** (meaning that a single algorithm can run as fast as possible on *any* graph topology) in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11793). Interestingly, in 2025 researchers reported an even faster approach. If you are a mathematical genius, you can take a look at [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10658) ‚Äî though honestly, I couldn‚Äôt understand it myself. üòÖ

### Measure ‚Äúimportance‚Äù in a network
- **Degree Centrality**: Measures how many direct connections a node has.  
  - "It‚Äôs not what you know, it‚Äôs who you know." ‚Äî a node with high degree is the social butterfly of the network.  

- **Closeness Centrality**: Quantifies how close a node is to all others in terms of shortest paths.  
  - Think of it as *how quickly you can spread gossip* across the entire network.  

- **Betweenness Centrality**: Counts how often a node lies on shortest paths between others.  
  - These are the *gatekeepers* or *bridges* of the network ‚Äî remove them, and communities fall apart.  

- **Eigenvector Centrality**: Goes beyond simple degree: a node is important if it connects to other important nodes.  
  - "Tell me who your friends are, and I will tell you who you are." ‚Äî proverb perfectly captures this idea.  
  - Famous example: Google‚Äôs **[PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank)** is a variant of eigenvector centrality. A similar idea also can be found in **[word2vec](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/word2vec)**.

- **Rich-Club Coefficient**: Describes the tendency of highly connected nodes to also connect with each other, forming an "elite club." 

## Task
In this exercise, you will practice several **fundamental network analysis methods** in ArcGIS Pro.  
The goal is to understand how networks can be built from road data and analyzed for accessibility, connectivity, and routing problems.  

### Overview
- [ ] **Build a network dataset**  
  - preprocess OSM road data, clean topology, and configure travel modes (e.g., walking).  
- [ ] **Explore the network**  
  - check connectivity and attributes using the Explore Network tool.  
- [ ] **OD Cost Matrix**  
  - calculate travel distances between origin and destination points.  
- [ ] **Shortest Route**  
  - find the optimal path between multiple stops using Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm.  
- [ ] **Traveling Salesman Problem**  
  - compute the shortest tour visiting all given stops.  
- [ ] **Isochrones (Service Areas)**  
  - construct reachable areas (e.g., 5-min walk) around transport stops.

#### Data
- `Data Students.gdb`

#### 1. Build the Network Dataset
- Create a new feature dataset in the geodatabase.  
- Preprocess OSM roads: fix overshoots/undershoots, remove pseudo-nodes, handle overpasses.  
- Configure cost attributes (e.g., length in meters) and build the network.  

#### 2. Explore the Network
- Use the **Explore Network** tool to check connectivity and ensure topology is valid.  

#### 3. OD Cost Matrix
- Select multiple origins and destinations.  
- Generate a cost matrix showing travel distance between each pair.  

#### 4. Shortest Route
- Add stops along the network.  
- Run the shortest path solver to find optimal routes.  

#### 5. Traveling Salesman Problem
- Input multiple stops (unordered).  
- Calculate the shortest tour that visits all of them once.  

#### 6. Isochrones (Service Areas)
- Define transport stops as facilities.  
- Generate service areas for 5, 10, 15 minutes walking distance.  
- Visualize and compare reachability zones.

  - [Exploring and Analyzing Network Data with Python](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/exploring-and-analyzing-network-data-with-python)  

- Build your own interactive web map:  
  - Choose two locations and compute the **shortest path** using a web map service.  
  - Set different travel modes (car, bicycle, or foot) and compare routes.  
  - Select one location, define a radius, and **visualize the buffer area** on the map.
