```{admonition} ðŸ¤– A quick note on using AI
Sure, AI tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, and their cousins can be helpful â€” sometimes they explain things better than your textbooks, while sometimes they confidently make things up that sound real. ðŸ˜…
Weâ€™re not here to ban them â€” feel free to ask them for help. But hereâ€™s the deal:

<strong>Donâ€™t let AI do all the thinking for you & Don't indulge in idle queries</strong>. Itâ€™s like letting a GPS plan your road trip without checking if itâ€™s sending you into a lake.
If you really want to learn, go beyond AI:
â†’ Read the official docs, watch a real tutorial, check the source code, struggle a bit â€” thatâ€™s how the magic happens.
